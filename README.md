# EmpHackathon
EMP Hackathon project by Jonathan, Kaushal, Brendan, and Rohan


## Description

Assists in the future of space exploration
by informing and preparing the general public the skills
and everyday scenarios that they must be accustomed to go through.

By having bite-sized lessons, we are able to captivate the user
and slowly build up comprehension to mastery.

Lessons Include:
* High G's Breathing
* Avoiding Collisions
